- do as few changes as possible to achieve the task
- stick to html, css, and js unless specifically asked to do otherwise
- keep things simple, clean, readable, and maintainable
- keep existing style and do not make major changes without double checking and asking
- this is an html css js project no server needed
- popup.js has all the logic for showing, dismissing, clicking, positioning popups
- popup-text/image/video.js is should only contain the logic for creating the content for the popup, and no nothing about positioning or popup logic
